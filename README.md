# ARM-Assembly
Here is some of the work I did using ARM while learning assembly for 4 months.

# Description:
This file contains many short ARM assembly experiments covering addressing modes, data access (byte/word), stack operations, multiple-register store/load, conditional execution, simple algorithms (GCD), and small data-layout examples. These snippets show hands-on experience with low-level programming, memory and register manipulation, and ARM instruction set features useful for embedded/firmware and systems roles.
